# KGoDApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.2.

## Setup

In to run the frontend from source, an installation of [Node.js, LTS Version](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required. Afterwards, Angular needs to be installed globally by running `npm install -g @angular/cli` in a command prompt in any folder. Now `npm install` can be run in the folder of the frontend to install all required dependencies. With `ng serve` a local development instance can be started, which will make the frontend accessible on `http://localhost:4200`. For a more permanent installation, `ng build --prod` can be run which will generate a compiled version in the `dist` folder. The contents of the `dist` folder can then be served by any webserver, like nginx or Apache.
